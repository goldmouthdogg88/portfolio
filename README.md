## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!

Create a portfolio website

This is to set up the structure, allowing you to customize it how you want.


 - Keep it as static files
 - Use the structure along with a static stie generator such as Jekyll or Eleventy

 - Turn it into a React app
 - etc...


- We're going to focus on the CSS and design side. We're going to structure it out properly

 - Assume we're comfortable with HTML and CSS. We will be using CSS custom properties.

 - Early setup custom properties then modify later. We'll be using flexbox and grid.

 - Not an indepth tutorial

- Links to mroe in-dpeth tutorials in videos that mention specific topics
